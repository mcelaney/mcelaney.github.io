## About this site

I'm not good at keeping up with a blog... but it's not from a lack of trying. My original blog started in the 90s back when it wasn't considered retro to call it a "weblog."  Check out this header from my blog in 2005:

By that point I had been bad blogging for about 10 years...

I think part of the reason I suck at keeping up with a blog is thinking of it as a running log of whatever I have going on in the moment... which really only worked when I was good at writing in the moment. Eventually I'd slip and get out of the habit of writing... and before long it was years later and I was writing yet another first blog post about how I was gonna take it serious this time.

This time out I'm looking to do something different.

This time I'm looking to use this site to curate a fairly hefty backlog of content I've been sitting on for years. Some of it notes from my days as a tech consultant, some emails and conversations I tend to repeat a lot while helping people out, some of it conference talks and classes I've been trying to pull together.

So rather than this being a strem of "article I wrote on a specific date" it will be a collection of posts that will be more of a work in progress. I'm not sure how I'll account for that yet - but if you have ideas I'd love to hear about it.

### My Background

I'm currently the VP of Digital Product Development at [Nerd St Gamers](https://nerdstgamers.com) - an esports content, events, and venue provider headquartered in Philly. I started at Nerd in July of 2020 - and it's the fifth organization I've been proud to serve in an product or engineering management capacity. I also ran teams at Electronic Ink, Tamman Technology, WebLinc, and Think Company. This is my first time working in the gaming industry.

I’m a self-taught developer. As an individual contributor I identify as a polyglot backend engineer. My current “default stack” is Elixir’s Phoenix Framework on PostgreSQL. About half of my career before think was working on various retail products - mostly ecommerce and logistics software. Before that I worked for consultancies on enterprise CMS implementations, healthcare applications (EMR, firmware, and equipment monitoring systems, mostly) and commercial banking software (ForEx trading, fraud/risk monitoring, and credit default swap systems).

Before I was a “professional developer” I was a sergeant in the US Marine Corps -- and a good bit of my management philosophy was formed during that time of my life. I mainly served in a public relations role... but my military career was complicated.

As an active duty Marine I interned at the Pentagon before attending the venerable Defence Information School in Fort Meade, MD with specialties in photojournalism and broadcast journalism. I spent 3 years at MCB Quantico and left the military in the Spring of 2001. Later I was involuntarily called back to active duty service twice - first in 2003 as an infantry squad leader for a convoy security unit in Iraq; then for a SOC anti-terrorism task force in the Horn of Africa. (I wasn’t always the pudgy doughboy we know and love today.)

I’m not shy about any of it... feel free to ask.

While I consider 2006 the beginning of my professional software career - I wrote several CMS platforms during my military career (mostly in support of newsrooms). My first non-trivial application (a Perl-based cgi script that simplified telephone billing for dorm rooms at Villanova University) went into production in 1996.

In addition to the military and code I’ve been paid to:

* Take Photos - over 200 bylines in publications internationally including Forbes, Maxim, and most major US newspapers
* Cook BBQ - I work as a pitmaster at events on occasion
* Drink Wine - I’m a certified Intermediate-level sommelier currently classified as French wine specialist and certified wine educator.

### A note on the tech

This blog runs on Jekyll and I wrote literally none of the code involved. Theme used is <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/journal-personal-jekyll-theme">"Journal" by Jekyll Themes</a>. Not proud of being this lazy... but if I waited till I took the time to piece together a design of my own this thing would never get out the door.
