## 1. Know How To Read A Contract

The military runs on a forrests-worth of orders, policy, procedure, and guidance. A truly ungodly amount of content written by boring people for boring reasons using very exact language. (By way of example: here is MCBO 5230.4 -- the first one I helped write) That said - you don’t get to do anything more important than mowing the lawn in the Marines without reading and understanding what’s expected of you.

I was fortunate to have worked for Marines who taught me understanding the language of those orders would give me more control over my career.

In 1998 I was a community relations rep at MCB Quantico who was super interested in working on websites. But that wasn’t a job. My days were pretty full of phone answering and paperwork… so while most military units were happy to let me write software and design websites on my own time - I had no real authority or budget to do so… and I certainly didn’t have any help.

So the officer I worked for encouraged me to read the dozen or so orders and memorandums that applied and agreed to help me draft a new order to change the situation. You can see the list at the top of the order. It was droll reading at best… but we used it all as justification to create a new role (MCBO 5230.4.7.c.(9)) that I could play in the Public Affairs Office; training webmasters, documenting their work, and doing web design (poorly… that’s a different story) for a living.

A few months later our draft was released and units started preparing… by the time it signed in December of 2000 I had a staff of 60 or so developers and was traveling around the country working with J Walter Thompson consultants on a pattern library for the entire USMC.

It didn’t take long once I got out of the Marines to connect the dots - contracts were just policy orders. I ended up taking a few contract law classes at UTPB and it’s made a huge difference in my career.

## 2. Self care matters

One of the most jarring parts of transitioning from the military to civilian life for me was the way civilian employers looked at the employee benefits as priviledges... as though they were doing you a favor by giving you things like medical care or time off.
