<h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2>

<p>I’m not good at keeping up with a blog… but it’s not from a lack of trying. My original blog started in the 90s back when it wasn’t considered retro to call it a “weblog.”  Check out this header from my blog in 2005:</p>

<p><img src="/images/me/old-blog.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>By that point I had been bad blogging for about 10 years…</p>

<p>I think part of the reason I suck at keeping up with a blog is thinking of it as a running log of whatever I have going on in the moment… which really only worked when I was good at writing in the moment. Eventually I’d slip and get out of the habit of writing… and before long it was years later and I was writing yet another first blog post about how I was gonna take it serious this time.</p>

<p>This time out I’m looking to do something different.</p>

<p>This time I’m looking to use this site to curate a fairly hefty backlog of content I’ve been sitting on for years. Some of it notes from my days as a tech consultant, some emails and conversations I tend to repeat a lot while helping people out, some of it conference talks and classes I’ve been trying to pull together.</p>

<p>So rather than this being a strem of “article I wrote on a specific date” it will be a collection of posts that will be more of a work in progress. I’m not sure how I’ll account for that yet - but if you have ideas I’d love to hear about it.</p>

<h3 id="my-background">My Background</h3>

<p>I’m currently the VP of Digital Product Development at <a href="https://nerdstgamers.com">Nerd St Gamers</a> - an esports content, events, and venue provider headquartered in Philly. I started at Nerd in July of 2020 - and it’s the fifth organization I’ve been proud to serve in an product or engineering management capacity. I also ran teams at Electronic Ink, Tamman Technology, WebLinc, and Think Company. This is my first time working in the gaming industry.</p>

<p>I’m a self-taught developer. As an individual contributor I identify as a polyglot backend engineer. My current “default stack” is Elixir’s Phoenix Framework on PostgreSQL. About half of my career before think was working on various retail products - mostly ecommerce and logistics software. Before that I worked for consultancies on enterprise CMS implementations, healthcare applications (EMR, firmware, and equipment monitoring systems, mostly) and commercial banking software (ForEx trading, fraud/risk monitoring, and credit default swap systems).</p>

<p>Before I was a “professional developer” I was a sergeant in the US Marine Corps – and a good bit of my management philosophy was formed during that time of my life. I mainly served in a public relations role… but my military career was complicated.</p>

<p>As an active duty Marine I interned at the Pentagon before attending the venerable Defence Information School in Fort Meade, MD with specialties in photojournalism and broadcast journalism. I spent 3 years at MCB Quantico and left the military in the Spring of 2001. Later I was involuntarily called back to active duty service twice - first in 2003 as an infantry squad leader for a convoy security unit in Iraq; then for a SOC anti-terrorism task force in the Horn of Africa. (I wasn’t always the pudgy doughboy we know and love today.)</p>

<p>I’m not shy about any of it… feel free to ask.</p>

<p>While I consider 2006 the beginning of my professional software career - I wrote several CMS platforms during my military career (mostly in support of newsrooms). My first non-trivial application (a Perl-based cgi script that simplified telephone billing for dorm rooms at Villanova University) went into production in 1996.</p>

<p>In addition to the military and code I’ve been paid to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take Photos - over 200 bylines in publications internationally including Forbes, Maxim, and most major US newspapers</li>
  <li>Cook BBQ - I work as a pitmaster at events on occasion</li>
  <li>Drink Wine - I’m a certified Intermediate-level sommelier currently classified as French wine specialist and certified wine educator.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-note-on-the-tech">A note on the tech</h3>

<p>This blog runs on Jekyll and I wrote literally none of the code involved. Theme used is <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/journal-personal-jekyll-theme">“Journal” by Jekyll Themes</a>. Not proud of being this lazy… but if I waited till I took the time to piece together a design of my own this thing would never get out the door.</p>
