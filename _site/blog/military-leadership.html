    <p>10 Things the military taught me about leadership</p>

		<h2 id="1-know-how-to-read-a-contract">1. Know How To Read A Contract</h2>

<p>The military runs on a forrests-worth of orders, policy, procedure, and guidance. A truly ungodly amount of content written by boring people for boring reasons using very exact language. (By way of example: here is <a href="https://www.quantico.marines.mil/Portals/147/Adjutant/SSIC/05000/MCBO%205230.4%20-%20POLICY%20AND%20PROCEDURES%20FOR%20ESTABLISHING%20AND%20CONTENT.pdf">MCBO 5230.4</a> – the first one I helped write) That said - you don’t get to do anything more important than mowing the lawn in the Marines without reading and understanding what’s expected of you.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to have worked for Marines who taught me understanding the language of those orders would give me more control over my career.</p>

<p>In 1998 I was a community relations rep at MCB Quantico who was super interested in working on websites. But that wasn’t a job. My days were pretty full of phone answering and paperwork… so while most military units were happy to let me write software and design websites on my own time - I had no real authority or budget to do so… and I certainly didn’t have any help.</p>

<p>So the officer I worked for encouraged me to read the dozen or so orders and memorandums that applied and agreed to help me draft a new order to change the situation. You can see the list at the top of the order. It was droll reading at best… but we used it all as justification to create a new role (MCBO 5230.4.7.c.(9)) that I could play in the Public Affairs Office; training webmasters, documenting their work, and doing web design (poorly… that’s a different story) for a living.</p>

<p>A few months later our draft was released and units started preparing… by the time it signed in December of 2000 I had a staff of 60 or so developers and was traveling around the country working with J Walter Thompson consultants on a pattern library for the entire USMC.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long once I got out of the Marines to connect the dots - contracts were just policy orders. I ended up taking a few contract law classes at UTPB and it’s made a huge difference in my career.</p>

<h2 id="2-dont-lead-by-bad-example">2. Don’t Lead By Bad Example</h2>

<p>Years ago I had just returned from one mission when we got the call for another emergency - two helicopters crashed for unknown reasons in a remote area… we needed to drive up there, secure the site, and look for survivors. I had been up a while and was due a night off… but getting to the crash site was going to require an overnight offroad drive through an area I knew better than most. I also had a camera and night vision equipment assigned to me that would be helpful so double bonus points. The ops chief asked whether I felt ok to drive. I was tired… but coffee exists… so I said I was good to go so long as I had someone in the vehicle to help me stay awake.</p>

<p>He put me in as the driver of the lead vehicle in the convoy and then assigned a major who hated my guts to the passenger seat.</p>

<p>We spent around nine hours confirming we had little in common and exploring reasons to dislike each until we arrived at the location of the crash. (At least it kept me awake.) We didn’t immediately find the people we were looking for so I took a bunch of my Marines and set up camp. It was a young group - mostly early-20-something reservists. We made short work of the setup and then rejoined the search parties.</p>

<p>Day rolled into evening rolled into night. Navy rescue divers ended up finding bodies instead of people; but at least we found all of them. We were ordered to stay and guard the site… so we settled in to be there for a while. But at this point our spirits were broken. It was an exhaustion that was hard to describe. If hope does a fair job at holding off exhaustion then sadness is just as good at letting it in.</p>

<p>Still - this was a dangerous place to be. It fell to me to set the watch list. Leading by example was important to me so I took the first and second watch. I figured the kids needed sleep… this was rough and new to them. By the time I finally fell asleep I had been awake a little over 60 hours.</p>

<p>The next morning a master sergeant pulled me aside to ream me out.</p>

<p>“You need to learn your limits, Mac,” he said (sorta… the real dialogue had was more explicatives and threats). “You know you were awake longer than you should have been. You didn’t do anybody any favors by playing the martyr and not finding rack time yesterday.”</p>

<p>I was pretty indignant … and insubordinate on a good day. (I really was not great at being a Marine.) “Wait a minute - name one mistake I made?”</p>

<p>“We’re a team - we needed a leader out of you not a hero. So instead of assigning someone else to handle things you risked all our lives because you were probably too scared to sleep - and now they are out there talking about what a great guy you are. You showed a bunch of young Marines who look up to you that working yourself past your limit is something to admire.”</p>

<p>“I was trying to lead by example,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You took watch when you were too tired to see straight. That’s the example you want to set? I should &lt;I forget the specific threat… he was more than capable of follow through, though&gt;.”</p>

<p>but that was the jist and he wasn’t wrong. I thought I had good intentions - but I couldn’t see past this need to do things myself. And that need was definitely grounded in fear.</p>

<h2 id="3-take-time-off">3. Take Time Off</h2>

<p>One of the most jarring parts of transitioning from the military to civilian life for me was the way civilian employers looked at the employee benefits as priviledges… as though they were doing you a favor by giving you things like medical care or time off.</p>
